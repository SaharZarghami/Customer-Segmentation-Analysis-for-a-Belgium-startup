I undertook a systematic approach to analyze the sales data for a Belgian startup company from January 2023 which installed fridges in coworking spaces and offices to sell food and beverages, covering 16 unique products and numerous customer transactions. Then, preprocessed the dataset to check for missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
